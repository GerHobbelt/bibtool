** Description:
**	This header file contains includes for all other header files
**	belonging to the \BibTool{} C library. It is here for the
**	convenience of the C programmer who does not have to include
**	two dozen header files but can use this single file. Thus any
**	C program which utilizes the \BibTool{} C library can start as
**	follows:
**
**	\verb|#include <bibtool/bibtool.h>|
**
**      Note that this include file also contains includes to system
**	specific header files. They are determined during configuration.
